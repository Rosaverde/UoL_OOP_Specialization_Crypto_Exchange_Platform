# Simplified Crypto-Trading Platform

University of London - Object Oriented Programming Specialization

In this specialisation, we will build a single, large project: a cryptocurrency trading platform. 

The program runs in the command-line in text mode and it simulates the experience of buying and selling cryptocurrencies. 
The program works with a real data set representing the order book of a real currency exchange platform.
